Hello user!

This is all the files that are needed to replicate the hognose morph calculator as I created it. It is currently
being hosted on the UNO Odin server, so you will need a server of your own to duplicate it.

The .py file is what will actually calculate the probabilities, the .php file displays the page, the .sql file generates the database
in MySQL. You will need to change some code in that file to fit YOUR database.

The python file has been edited to reorder the output alphabetically with uppercase letters being placed first for
ease of het detection. So this: "xXdSds" becomes: "ddDsXx".

Currently, the webpage will provide you with the needed genotype that you can use with the python script, but they do not work together, yet.
